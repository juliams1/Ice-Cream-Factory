# Ice-Cream-Factory
Learning Java project

Hi, eveyone! This is a simple Java project simulating an ice cream factory. The code consists of two main classes:

## IceCreamFactory.java
- Contains the logic for ice cream production.
- The `main` method serves as the entry point, initiating and finalizing the ice cream production. During production, it creates an instance of the `IceCreamMaker` class and calls its `makeIceCream()` method.

## IceCreamMaker.java
- Represents an ice cream maker.
- Features a `makeIceCream` method that prints the message "Produzindo sorvetes a todo valor!"

Enjoy your ice cream!
